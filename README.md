## Overview of Analysis
Meat substitutes have been made from algae, fungi, and microorganisms. Improbable Beef, a food startup, is looking for the best beef alternative. They are looking for a bacterial species that has the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. In the search for this bacterium, belly buttons of volunteer test subjects were sampled to identify bacteria cultures. There are thousands of types of bacteria found all over the human body. Perhaps one of these bacterium types, found in the navel, can synthesize proteins that taste like beef.

## Results
A web page was made to display the data. The web page consists of a demographics panel and several charts. The fist chart displayed is a horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 bacteria cultures found in each sample. There is a gauge chart reporting the frequency of belly button washings per week. Finally a bubble chart displays the number of bacteria cultures per sample. 

## Summary
This webpage will allow volunteers to look though the dataset and identify which bacterial species are found in their navels', if Improbable Beef identifies a species of bacterium as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. The dashboard was customized with an image added to the Jumbotron, a compatible background color, and text with added information about the project.
